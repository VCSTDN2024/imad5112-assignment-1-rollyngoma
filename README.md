## Purpose of the App

The **Meal Suggestion App** helps people choose what to eat based on the time of day. When a user clicks a button (Morning, Afternoon, or Evening), the app shows a meal idea.

This app was developed as part of the IMAD5112 module to practice building Android apps using **Kotlin** and **Android Studio**.

## Design Choices

The app was designed to be simple and easy to use. Here are the main design choices:

- **Layout**: I used `ConstraintLayout` because it works well on different screen sizes.
- **Colors**: I chose a **white background** with **navy blue** to make the app look clean and professional.
- **Buttons**: I styled the buttons using custom XML files with **rounded edges**.
- **Text**: The meal suggestion is displayed clearly in the middle of the screen.

## Using GitHub

I used GitHub to save my code and track progress. Here's how it helped:

- I made **commits often** to save work step by step.
- GitHub **stores the code safely online**, so I can access it from anywhere.
- It makes it easy for the lecturer to **review and mark** my project.

## Using GitHub Actions

In this project, I **did not fully use GitHub Actions**, but I learned that I can use it in the future to:

- Run checks on my code automatically when I upload it.
- Make sure there are no errors.
- Build or test the app without doing it manually.

GitHub Actions is useful for **saving time and catching issues early**.
